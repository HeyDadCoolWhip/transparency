# transparency | The Web App

#### What is "transparency"?

"Transparency" is a web app developed by mke.
It is not supposed to be a "true" web app but more so of a project to test
the limits regarding his knowledge of coding.

#### Why name it "transparency"?

No idea.
I doubt even he himself has any idea as to why he chose that name, possibly due to him scrolling through GitHub
repositories and just came upon that word?

#### What will be included in this project?

I have no clue, it is all up to him to decide.
He has free-range of the project as it belongs to him, so I have no control over it.
